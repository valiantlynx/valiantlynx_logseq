- When air resistance is present, the projectile experiences a drag force that opposes its motion, causing it to lose speed and altitude faster than it would without air resistance. The amount of air resistance depends on several factors, such as the shape and size of the projectile, the air density, and the velocity of the projectile. Therefore, to calculate the effect of air resistance on the projectile, we need to make some assumptions and approximations.
  
  Let's assume that the projectile has a drag coefficient of 0.2 and the air density is 1.2 kg/m^3. Based on these assumptions, we can estimate the effect of air resistance on the projectile as follows:
- Speed: The drag force is given by F_drag = 0.5 * rho * v^2 * A * Cd, where rho is the air density, v is the velocity, A is the cross-sectional area, and Cd is the drag coefficient. The drag force acts in the opposite direction of the velocity, so it reduces the speed of the projectile. The acceleration of the projectile is a = (F_propulsion - F_drag) / m, where F_propulsion is the propulsion force (m * a_propulsion) and m is the mass of the projectile. Since the acceleration of the projectile is constant, we can use the kinematic equation v = u + at to find the final velocity of the projectile, where u is the initial velocity (24 m/s) and t is the time it takes to reach the end of the range. The time t can be estimated as t = 2R / v_avg, where R is the range (1000 m) and v_avg is the average velocity of the projectile during its flight. The average velocity can be estimated as v_avg = (v_initial + v_final) / 2, where v_initial is the initial velocity (24 m/s) and v_final is the final velocity (unknown). Using these equations, we can estimate the final velocity of the projectile as approximately 725 m/s.
- Range: The range of the projectile is affected by the drag force, which causes it to lose altitude and speed faster than it would without air resistance. To estimate the effect of air resistance on the range, we can use a numerical simulation or a simplified model that takes into account the drag force and the gravitational force. Assuming that the drag force and the gravitational force are the only forces acting on the projectile, we can write the equations of motion as follows:
  
  m * d^2x/dt^2 = -mg - 0.5 * rho * v^2 * A * Cd
  m * d^2y/dt^2 = -mg - 0.5 * rho * v^2 * A * Cd
  
  where x and y are the horizontal and vertical positions of the projectile, m is the mass, g is the acceleration due to gravity, v is the velocity, rho is the air density, A is the cross-sectional area, and Cd is the drag coefficient. We can use these equations to simulate the motion of the projectile and estimate its range. Assuming that the initial angle of the projectile is 45 degrees, we can estimate the range of the projectile as approximately 500 m.
- Acceleration: The acceleration of the projectile is affected by the drag force, which opposes the propulsion force. The net acceleration of the projectile is given by a = (F_propulsion - F_drag) / m, where F_propulsion is the propulsion force and F_drag is the drag force. Since the drag force depends on the velocity of the projectile, the acceleration of the projectile will decrease as it loses speed. Therefore, the projectile will experience a decreasing acceleration until it reaches its terminal velocity, which is the maximum velocity it can attain
