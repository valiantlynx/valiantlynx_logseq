- For the C clamp shown, a force is applied at the end of the 3/8-in diameter handle. The screw is a 3/4 in-6 Acme thread (see the figure), and is 10 in long overall, with a maximum of 8 in possible in the clamping region. The handle and screw are both made from cold-drawn AISI 1006 steel. The coefficients of friction for the screw and the collar are 0.15. The collar, which in this case is the anvil striker’s swivel joint, has a friction diameter of 1 in. It is desired that the handle will yield before the screw will fail. Check this by the following steps.
  **(a) **Determine the maximum force that can be applied to the end of the handle to reach the point of yielding of the handle.
  **(b) **Using the force from part (a), determine the clamping force.
  **(c) **Using the force from part (a), determine the factor of safety for yielding at the interface of the screw body and the base of the first engaged thread, assuming the first thread carries 38 percent of the total clamping force.
