- For the C clamp shown, a force is applied at the end of the 3/8-in diameter handle. The screw is a 3/4 in-6 Acme thread (see the figure), and is 10 in long overall, with a maximum of 8 in possible in the clamping region. The handle and screw are both made from cold-drawn AISI 1006 steel. The coefficients of friction for the screw and the collar are 0.15. The collar, which in this case is the anvil striker’s swivel joint, has a friction diameter of 1 in. It is desired that the handle will yield before the screw will fail. Check this by the following steps.
	- **(a)** Determine the maximum force that can be applied to the end of the handle to reach the point of yielding of the handle.
		- The yield strength of cold-drawn AISI 1006 steel is 30,000 psi. The cross-sectional area of the handle can be found using the formula for the area of a circle:
		- A_handle = π/4 * d_handle^2 = π/4 * (3/8 in)^2 = 0.08836 in^2
		- The maximum force that can be applied to the handle before it yields is:
		- F_yielding_handle = σ_yielding * A_handle = 30,000 psi * 0.08836 in^2 = 2,650.8 lbf
		- However, the actual maximum force that can be applied to the handle is limited by the friction between the screw and the collar. The friction force can be found using the formula:
		- F_friction = μ * F_normal
		- where μ is the coefficient of friction and F_normal is the normal force between the screw and the collar. The normal force can be found using the principle of static equilibrium:
		- F_normal + F_clamping = F_applied
		- where F_clamping is the clamping force and F_applied is the applied force at the end of the handle. The clamping force can be found using the torque balance equation:
		- T = F_clamping * L_screw = F_applied * L_handle
		- where L_screw is the distance between the collar and the end of the screw and L_handle is the length of the handle.
		- Substituting the equation for F_clamping into the equation for F_normal and solving for F_applied, we get:
		- F_applied = F_friction / (μ + L_screw/L_handle)
		- Substituting the given values, we get:
		- F_applied = 2,650.8 lbf * 0.15 / (0.15 + 8/10) = 68 lbf
		- Therefore, the maximum force that can be applied to the end of the handle to reach the point of yielding of the handle is 68 lbf.
	- **(b) **Using the force from part (a), determine the clamping force.
	- **(c) **Using the force from part (a), determine the factor of safety for yielding at the interface of the screw body and the base of the first engaged thread, assuming the first thread carries 38 percent of the total clamping force.
