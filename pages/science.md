	- Charles Darwin (1809-1882) was an English naturalist and evolutionary biologist. He is best known for his profoundly influential theory of evolution, which he proposed through his seminal work "On the Origin of Species," published in 1859. Darwin proposed that all life on Earth had descended from a single common ancestor and that the process of evolution by natural selection is the mechanism by which this descent occurred. His work would influence many generations of biologists and non-biologists alike, earning him the title of "Father of Evolution".
