			  Yes, this is possible to do. Using SVG, HTML and JavaScript can allow for developers to create models that can be rendered in the browser. This could work in a similar way to how Blender works with Python, with JavaScript code defining the objects, shapes and transforms of the model, and HTML, SVG and JavaScript working together to render them in the browser window. Additionally, there are several existing libraries and frameworks available to aid in this development process, such as three.js, which offer robust toolsets for creating models, animations and other elements in the browser.
