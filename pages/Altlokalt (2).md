	- The use of rocket engines enables machines to travel in space and reach high speeds. Rockets vary in size, from very small "micro" rockets to large launch vehicles that can deliver payloads to space. Rockets can be powered by conventional fuels like kerosene or hydrogen, or by reaction mass from propellant-based systems, like liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen, air-breathing rocket engines, and ion drives. can i make a rocket with alternative sources of duel that's not combustion, i am a engineer
