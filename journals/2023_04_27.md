- While the nut travels through the air it experiences air resistance. this affects our range and power quite a bit so we had to account for it.
  we assumed that the seed had a drag coefficient of 0.2 and the air density is 1.2 kg/m^3. this is because the drag coefficient was the average of similar size object like paintballs. The air density is at sea level.
- we need to calculate the acceleration of the 10-seed at the beginning and end of its trajectory, as well as its velocity at 300 meters taking into account air resistance at normal atmospheric pressure.
- to do this we used the formula a = (v_f^2 - v_i^2) / (2 * d)
	- a is acceleration, v_f is final velocity (100 m/s), v_i is initial velocity (24.37 m/s), and d is distance traveled (300 m).
- a = (100^2 - 24.37^2) / (2 * 300) = 27.23 m/s^2
- To calculate the acceleration of the pellet at the end of its trajectory, we can assume that air resistance causes the pellet to decelerate uniformly from 100 m/s to 0 m/s over the last 300 meters. We can use the formula:
- a = (v_f - v_i) / t
	- a is acceleration, v_f is final velocity (0 m/s), v_i is initial velocity (100 m/s), and t is time.
- a = (0 - 100) / (300 / (100 / 3.6)) = -1.08 m/s^2
- the velocity of the pellet at 300 meters taking into account air resistance, we can use the following equation:
- v_f = sqrt((2 * m * g) / (p * A * C * rho * d)),
	- v_f is final velocity (unknown), m is mass (0.01 kg), g is acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s^2), p is pressure (300 bar), A is surface area (0.01 m^2), C is drag coefficient (0.47 for a sphere), rho is air density (1.2 kg/m^3), and d is distance traveled (300 m).
- v_f = sqrt((2 * 0.01 * 9.81) / (300 * 10^5 * 0.01 * 0.47 * 1.2 * 300)) = 89.8 m/s
- air resistance is approximately 89.8 m/s.
- this was 10 percent less that our original speed. 
  because of this if we input this speed in the earlier equation. the maximum range shortens to 826
- Even though this is the maximum range the seed would most likely have lost all energy at that point to be able to take down a drone. that is why we were calculating with 300 -400 m. The seed gun only needs to have enough energy at this point to take down a drone. fortunately the even with lower speed it was still able to take down a drone. it achieved the same energies as earlier(enough to take break plastic) at a range of 410 m. This was shorter from the earlier 500m.
- This proved that even accounting for drag. our seed gun was still able to cover the scope.
- A very useful featured of the pressure powered seed gun, is that it is rather silent. whether it is active or just repressurizing. Below is an image of the seed gun positioning. They are position to mainly protect the runway, but also to minimize civilian proximity. We decided to use 6 seed suns. each seed gun has a range of around 400 m radius to defend.
