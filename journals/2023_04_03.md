- if altlokalt and valiantlynx become bigger  and multiple different projects ill need a monorepo.
  to my futureself check out nx, turbo repo or lerna
- it seems i might have to learn rust. i debated if it should be go or rust. because im currently using typescript and its taking 4sec/file write. im expecting a thousand files. im too lazy to wait. go is easier to learn but it seems ill learn more from rust and next semester im going to learn c/c++ from school. so maybe that. i dont know if i want to do that now though. both are great but it doesnt matter since ill learn all of them eventually. for mow not go, probably rust

- machine code
	- ive hearn that all our programming language is just a long array of bits. 30000 bits of between 0-255 i think. explain and teach me about this ive never been through this before
	- Yes, you're right! All programming languages are ultimately just a long sequence of bits, which are binary digits that can have the value 0 or 1. A byte, which is the unit of memory commonly used to represent data in computers, consists of 8 bits, and can represent a value between 0 and 255 (or between 00000000 and 11111111 in binary).
	- When you write a program in a programming language, such as JavaScript or Python, it is first translated into machine code, which is a sequence of bytes that the computer can understand and execute. Machine code is specific to the architecture of the computer that the program is running on, and typically consists of a series of instructions that tell the computer what operations to perform and how to manipulate data.
	- To see an example of what machine code looks like, you can use a tool called a disassembler, which can convert machine code back into assembly language, which is a human-readable form of machine code. Here's an example of some x86 machine code for a simple "Hello, world!" program:
	- ```
	  rCopy code
	  - 48 83 ec 08             sub    rsp,0x8
	  48 8d 3d d1 00 00 00    lea    rdi,[rip+0xd1]        # 100000f <_start+0xf>
	  b0 01                   mov    al,0x1
	  e8 7a 00 00 00          call   1000018 <_puts@plt>
	  b8 3c 00 00 00          mov    eax,0x3c
	  48 31 ff                xor    rdi,rdi
	  0f 05                   syscall
	  ```
	- This machine code corresponds to the following assembly code:
	- ```
	  assemblyCopy code
	  - section .data
	  hello db "Hello, world!", 10
	  len equ $-hello
	  - section .text
	  global _start
	  - _start:
	    ; write the string to stdout
	    mov rax, 1          ; system call for write
	    mov rdi, 1          ; file descriptor for stdout
	    mov rsi, hello      ; pointer to string
	    mov rdx, len        ; string length
	    syscall
	  - ; exit the program with status code 0
	    mov rax, 60         ; system call for exit
	    xor rdi, rdi        ; exit status code (0)
	    syscall
	  ```
	- As you can see, the machine code consists of a sequence of bytes (in this case, represented as hexadecimal values), which correspond to the different instructions and operands in the assembly code. When the program is loaded into memory and executed by the computer, the processor reads these bytes and executes the corresponding instructions, which ultimately result in the program outputting "Hello, world!" to the console and then exiting.
	- I hope this helps give you a better understanding of how programming languages are translated into machine code, and what machine code looks like at the byte level!

	- is it just 1 long array ?
	- In a sense, yes, the machine code for a program is essentially one long array of bytes that the processor reads and executes. However, this array is typically organized into different sections, such as the code section, which contains the instructions that the processor executes, and the data section, which contains the program's data and variables.
	- The layout of these sections and the specific organization of the array can vary depending on the specific executable format being used, such as ELF or PE, which provide a standardized way of representing executable code and data on a given platform. These formats typically include metadata that describes the layout of the program's different sections and how they should be loaded into memory when the program is executed.
	- So while the machine code for a program is conceptually one long array of bytes, in practice it is often structured into different sections and organized in a specific way to facilitate efficient execution and memory management.

	- could you visualize it for me like a tiny example of the array
	- Sure! Here's a simple example of a program in x86 machine code:
	- ```
	  perlCopy code
	  - 55             push    ebp
	  89 e5          mov     ebp, esp
	  b8 00 00 00 00 mov     eax, 0
	  5d             pop     ebp
	  c3             ret
	  ```
	- This program simply sets the value of the `eax` register to zero and returns. Each line represents a byte of machine code, and the program is stored as a sequence of bytes in memory.
	- To visualize this as an array, we could represent each byte as a decimal number, since each byte is a number between 0 and 255. Here's how the program would look as an array of decimal values:
	- ```
	  csharpCopy code
	  - [85, 137, 229, 184, 0, 0, 0, 0, 93, 195]
	  ```
	- Each element in the array represents one byte of the program, and the array as a whole represents the complete program as a sequence of bytes. When the processor reads this array and executes the instructions it represents, it interprets each byte as a specific instruction or piece of data, and carries out the corresponding operation.

	- 2 / 2
	- do another example for hi
	- Sure! Here's a simple x86 assembly program that prints "hi" to the console:
	- ```
	  vbnetCopy code
	  - section .data
	    message db 'hi'
	  - section .text
	    global _start
	  - _start:
	    ; write 'hi' to stdout
	    mov eax, 4          ; system call number for 'write'
	    mov ebx, 1          ; file descriptor for stdout
	    mov ecx, message    ; address of the message string
	    mov edx, 2          ; number of bytes to write
	    int 0x80            ; invoke the system call
	  - ; exit
	    mov eax, 1          ; system call number for 'exit'
	    xor ebx, ebx        ; exit code of 0
	    int 0x80            ; invoke the system call
	  ```
	- In this program, we define a string containing the message "hi" in the `.data` section of the program, and then use the `write` system call to write that string to the console. After printing the message, the program exits with a return code of 0.
	- Here's how the program would look as an array of decimal values:
	- ```
	  csharpCopy code
	  - [32, 46, 100, 97, 116, 97, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 104, 4, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0xcd, 80, 104, 1, 0, 0, 0, 31, 195, 0xcd, 80]
	  ```
	- Each element in the array represents one byte of the program, and the array as a whole represents the complete program as a sequence of bytes. When the processor reads this array and executes the instructions it represents, it interprets each byte as a specific instruction or piece of data, and carries out the corresponding operation.

	- how would i run this code to test it
	- To run this code, you'll need an assembler and linker to turn the assembly code into an executable file that can be run on your computer.
	- One popular assembler for x86 architecture is NASM (Netwide Assembler), which is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. You can download NASM from the official website: [https://www.nasm.us/](https://www.nasm.us/)
	- Once you've installed NASM, save the code I provided as a file with a `.asm` extension (for example, `hi.asm`). Then, open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the file.
	- To assemble and link the code, run the following command:
	- ```
	  arduinoCopy code
	  - nasm -f elf32 -o hi.o hi.asm
	  ld -m elf_i386 -o hi hi.o
	  ```
	- This will create an object file `hi.o` and link it to create an executable file `hi`.
	- To run the program, simply execute the `hi` file:
	- ```
	  bashCopy code
	  - ./hi
	  ```
	- You should see the message "hi" printed to the console.
