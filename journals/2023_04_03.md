- if altlokalt and valiantlynx become bigger  and multiple different projects ill need a monorepo.
  to my futureself check out nx, turbo repo or lerna
- it seems i might have to learn rust. i debated if it should be go or rust. because im currently using typescript and its taking 4sec/file write. im expecting a thousand files. im too lazy to wait. go is easier to learn but it seems ill learn more from rust and next semester im going to learn c/c++ from school. so maybe that. i dont know if i want to do that now though. both are great but it doesnt matter since ill learn all of them eventually. for mow not go, probably rust
