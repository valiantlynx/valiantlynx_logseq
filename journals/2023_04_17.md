Therefore, a kosmonaut can be defined as someone who explores or travels in outer space. It is generally used to refer to Soviet Union-era astronauts but can also be used more broadly for anyone who travels in space.')

Secondly, the country of Kenya does not have its own astronaut in space. However, many Kenyans have been part of international missions such as the International Space Station. So, a Kenyan astronaut could be called a "Kenyan astronaut" or a "Kenyan space traveller".')
